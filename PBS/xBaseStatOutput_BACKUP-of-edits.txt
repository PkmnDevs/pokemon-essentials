###### Some edits may be made to pokemon.txt 
# This might be new pokemon, or changes to LearnSets, etc.
# Yet if xBaseStatScript-Semple.py is ever run, it needs to be run against
# the original pokemon.txt that does not contain edits (because it crunches
# the base-stats numbers, and we need those to be the original values before crunching).
##### SO THIS FILE IS A BACKUP OF ANY EDITS WE WANT TO KEEP 
# after running that script on a clean pokemon.txt
# These back up edits will need to be manually copy/pasted back into the new pokemon.txt

###### Firstly, do this search and replace all
## (so every pokemon can learn a semi-decent move to avoid any garbage early-learnsets):
# SEARCH: TutorMoves = 
# REPLACE: TutorMoves = SNARL,

###### Second, add this entire CUSTOM thing back into the bottom of the new pokemon.txt
